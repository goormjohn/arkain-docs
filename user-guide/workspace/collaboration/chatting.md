# Chatting

Users who receive access to the container can easily collaborate using the chat feature.

Once you enter the workspace, you will automatically be joined the chat room associated with that container, allowing real-time communication. The chat room can be accessed by clicking on the chat icon in the bottom right corner of the workspace.

In the list of users who have entered the chat room, the name of each user is displayed along with their cursor position. Clicking on a user in the list will navigate the editor to the cursor position of that user.
