# Ignore

Adding a file to the Ignore will exclude it from version control in the project. Click the **Settings**(<img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (2) (1).png" alt="" data-size="line">) button in the top right corner of Git Sidebar, select the **\[ignore list]** tab.

Specify the files you don't want Git to track here. The Ignore feature is useful for things like error logs or automatically generated files.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**If a file is already versioned by Git** (if it has been added to the repository)**, it will not be ignored.** Git already knows about it, so it can't ignore it.
{% endhint %}
