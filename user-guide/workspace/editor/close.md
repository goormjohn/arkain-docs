# Close

In Arkain’s editor, you can manage open files with various close options.

To close a single file, click the **\[X]** button on the file tab. This immediately closes the selected file tab from the editor.

For additional options, right-click on a file tab to open the context menu. From here, you can choose:

* **\[Close All]** to close every open file.
* **\[Close Other Tabs]** to close all files except the one you selected.
* **\[Close Tabs to the Right]** to close all files positioned to the right of the current tab.

If you only want to close saved files, click the **`…`** button at the top right of the editor and select **\[Close Saved]**. This will close all file tabs that have no unsaved changes.

{% hint style="info" %}
When the Workspace is split into multiple editor groups, close commands such as \[Close All], \[Close Other Tabs], or \[Close Tabs to the Right] only apply to the editors within the current split group, not across the entire Workspace.
{% endhint %}
