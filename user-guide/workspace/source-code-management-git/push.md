# Push

Send commits from your local repository to the remote repository.

Use it to share your code with other users when all your coding work is complete. If you are anonymous, this command requires user authentication.

If there are commits that have not been pushed, the **\[Push]** button on the top right of the Git Sidebar layout will be activated. Hovering over the **\[Push]** button will display the number of unpushed commits, or "Publish" if the branch is not in the remote repository.
