## About Credits 💳

Credits are the currency required for using containers. When you use containers, credits are deducted. Here’s what you need to know:

* **Price per Credit**: $0.02 💵
* **Minimum Purchase**: You can purchase credits starting from a minimum of **50 credits**. 🛒

### **Conditions for Credit Deductions ⚠️**

Credits are deducted under the following conditions:

1. **Container Specs**: Deductions occur based on the container specifications while the container is running. For detailed information, refer to the help documentation. 📊
2. **Traffic Usage**: If the total traffic from your container exceeds **10GB**, **10 credits** will be deducted for every additional **1GB** of traffic. 🌐
3. **Storage Usage**: If the storage usage of each container exceeds the default capacity, **0.018 credits** will be deducted per **1GB** of storage per hour. Storage is charged regardless of whether the container is running or stopped. 📦
4. **Free Credits**: You are awarded **45 free credits** on the first day of each month, which expire on the last day of the month. ⏳ (Award and expiration times are based on Coordinated Universal Time - UTC.)

You can monitor network traffic and storage usage for each container in the **Resources Monitor** panel at the bottom of the workspace and in the **Status bar**. 📈

## How Credits Are Calculated 🔍

This is a forecasting tool that provides an approximate cost based on your specified project or usage. However, the forecasted cost may differ from the actual cost due to various factors:

1. **Duration**: Assumes **720 hours** per month and does not account for leap years. ⏲️
2. **Promotional Credits**: Does not include promotional credits or discounts. 🎉
3. **Additional Charges**: Does not account for additional usage not included in the forecast (e.g., if you use more than **5GB** of storage on the Free plan, you pay **0.018 credits** per GB per hour). ⚠️
4. **Currency**: Forecasts are based on a fixed exchange rate. 💱
