## New Features

* The gpt-5.1 model is now available for use in the Side Chat.
* The model search feature and a list of recently used models are now available in the Side Chat.
* The Image Viewer now supports zoom controls and background color changes, making it easier to precisely view images in the Workspace.
* A new "[Download page](https://arkain.io/download)" is now available for the upcoming Arkain downloadable application.

## **Changes**

**Container management**

* [Auto-stop](https://docs.arkain.io/user-guide/dashboard/container/auto-stop) has been enabled by default when creating a container.
* The maximum storage capacity of the container has been changed from 200GB to 80GB.

**Arkain Snap**

* Added a 4,000-character limit to the Snap input box.
* Improved overall Snap performance and updated Quick Prompts to generate higher-quality results.
* Snap was updated to continue running in the background even when the page is closed or refreshed.
* Snap was updated to resume from where it left off after recharging credits and restarting the container, even if it stopped mid-execution due to insufficient credits.

**Workspace**

* Filename validation rules have been relaxed to allow most characters supported in Ubuntu-based environments. Only a few characters that could cause functional issues are restricted, offering more flexibility in naming files.
* When uploading files or folders, the Arkain Studio Upload pop-up is no longer displayed. Instead, the native file picker opens immediately, reducing unnecessary steps in the upload process.

**UI & Platforms**

* Template List page filter and sort preferences are now retained when navigating back from a Template Detail page.
* The default sorting order for template lists has been updated from Recent to Most Used.
* Improved the styling and usability of the Container Settings page and applied a dropdown for already invited users in the Share pop-up.
* Theme selector dropdown UI on the Dashboard page was updated to match the mobile interface for consistency.
* The Side Chat responses now include a typing animation to provide a more natural and engaging interaction experience.
