### What is Arkain's official template?

If you look through the templates, you will see templates with ![](../../.gitbook/assets/CertificateIcon.png)icon attached. These are templates that Arkain provides and produces, and as described, packages/modules for environment configuration are automatically installed and executed.

We hope that one day your templates will become official templates for Arkain.
