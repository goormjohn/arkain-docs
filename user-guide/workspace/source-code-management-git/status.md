# Status

Check the revision status of the current project files/folders in the Changes, Historys, Event tab of the Git Sidebar.

The Status tab displays files by whether they are staged or unstaged. You can change the status of files by selecting individual files or all checkboxes.

The Status tab reflects **the status of files through the Add, Commit, Push, Pull, and Ignore command functions**. Clicking on a file will open it in the editor.
