# Container Performance

## Container Performance

You can efficiently use Credits by adjusting the performance of the container based on your needs and usage purposes.

The number of Credits deducted during container usage varies depending on the performance, storage, traffic, and the advanced feature usage.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The cost for using the advanced features such as **AI Supporter and Code Supporter** is added to your container cost. However, when using a GPU container, there is no additional charge for these features; instead, your allocated **GPU compute and memory resources** will be reduced.

1 credit is priced at approximately $0.02. For detailed information, refer to [this](../../../credits-and-membership/credits/) documentation.

## Setting Container Performance <a href="#setting-container-specifications" id="setting-container-specifications"></a>

You can set the performance of the container when you create it, based on your requirements. Similarly, when creating a container through **Templates**, you can set the container performance.

Additionally, you can modify the performance of an existing container on the **Container Settings page** at any time, depending on your needs and purposes.
