# Push

A commit permanently stores the changed files in the local repository, but it does not affect the remote repository.

If there are commits that have not been pushed, the **\[Push]** button on the top right of the Git Sidebar layout will be activated. Click the **\[Push]** button to save the changes to the remote repository.
