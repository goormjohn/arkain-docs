# Convert Indentation

In Arkain’s editor, you can adjust indentation formatting using the **Convert Indentation** feature.

The **Convert Indentation** feature allows you to switch indentation between Tabs and Spaces. This makes it easy to standardize code formatting according to your project or team’s requirements.

When converting from Tabs to Spaces, the conversion follows the Tab Size defined in your Preferences. This ensures consistent spacing throughout the file.

To access this feature, open the editor, right-click, and select **\[Convert Indentation]**.
