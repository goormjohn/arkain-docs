# Credits

## **Conditions for Credit Deductions**

Credits are deducted under the following conditions:

* **Container Usage**\
  Credits deductions occur while the container is running, based on the container performance.
* **Storage Usage**\
  If the storage usage of each container exceeds **the free storage available for your plan**, 0.018 credits will be deducted per 1GB of storage per hour. Storage is charged **regardless of whether the container is running or stopped.**&#x20;
  * **Free Plan**: 5GB for free
  * **Membership Plan**: 15GB for free
* **Traffic Usage**\
  If your container's monthly cumulative traffic exceeds 10GB, you will be charged 8 credits for each additional 1GB of traffic.&#x20;

<summary>Credit terms</summary>

By paying for Arkain credits, you are deemed to have agreed to the paid service agreement. Members may cancel their unused credit purchase within 7 days from the date of purchase. However, if the contents of the contract are different from the contents displayed or advertised by the company or implemented differently from the contents of the contract, the subscription may be withdrawn within three months from the date of subscription or within 30 days from the date on which the fact was known or could have been known.

The refund amount will be calculated based on the following formulas.

●      Unused Amount = (Total Billed Amount / Number of Credits Purchased) x (Number of Credits that Remain Unused)

●      Refund Amount = Ceiling (Unused Amount)

The final refund amount will be rounded up to the nearest whole number (Ceiling) if it includes a decimal.

Arkain may provide credits to members based on promotions or members’ activity history, and the conditions and details of credit provision will be announced separately through Arkain.

If a member’s service is restricted or the member withdraws, the remaining credits shall be refunded if the request is made within 7 days from the date of purchase. In such cases, the refund process must be initiated through the Customer Center or the representative email address.

Arkain may change the price of credits at any time with prior consent from the members, and will not compensate members for any loss caused by the changed price.

Events can only be redeemed once. All purchase credits, including event credits, will be refunded upon refund.

If you paid for a credit purchase with a card, then canceling a payment will cancel to the card that you paid with. Upon refund, all promotional credits provided through this event will expire and are excluded from the refund amount. Please note that refunds cannot be processed if your remaining balance is less than the promotional credits received.
