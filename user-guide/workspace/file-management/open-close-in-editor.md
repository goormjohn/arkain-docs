# Open / Close in Editor

In Arkain's **Project Sidebar**, you can open source code files using the editor. Arkain offers a standard Code Editor.

## Code Editor

The Code Editor is a text editor that can be opened within the editor section. To open a file, double-click the file you want to open in the **Project Sidebar**, press <kbd>Enter</kbd> (macOS <kbd>Return ⏎</kbd>), or right-click and go to **\[Open]**.

Depending on the file's extension, it may open in the default editor, or a document viewer. Some unsupported file extensions cannot be opened.

## Close <a href="#close" id="close"></a>

Files opened in the Editor section can be closed by clicking the **\[X]** button on the file tab. Alternatively, you can press the default keyboard shortcut <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>W</kbd>  (macOS <kbd>⌥</kbd> <kbd>W</kbd>) to close the open file.

You can also right-click a file tab in the Editor section and select \[**Close]** to close that file tab. Selecting **\[Close All]** will close all open file tabs.
