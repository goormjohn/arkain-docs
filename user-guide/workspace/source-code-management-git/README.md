# Source Code Management Git

Git, developed by Linus Torvalds in 2005, is the most widely used version control system. As a distributed version control system (DVCS), Git helps manage code changes efficiently and facilitates seamless collaboration in software development.

Arkain supports GitHub, Bitbucket, and Git as remote repositories.

* **Git**:
  * **What it is**: Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) that allows multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other’s work. It tracks changes in your code, enabling you to revert to previous versions, merge changes, and collaborate more efficiently.
  * **How it works**: Git keeps track of the history of a project in a series of commits, each representing a snapshot of the project at a particular point in time. Developers can create branches to work on features or fixes independently and later merge them into the main project.
* **GitHub**:
  * **What it is**: GitHub is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories. It provides a web interface to work with Git repositories and includes additional features like issue tracking, project management tools, and pull requests to collaborate on code. It also offers social features like following other developers and starring repositories.
  * **How it works**: You push your local Git repositories to GitHub, where others can access, contribute, and review your code. GitHub’s pull request system allows contributors to propose changes and collaborate in a controlled way, ensuring code quality.
* **Bitbucket**:
  * **What it is**: Bitbucket is another platform that offers Git repository hosting, but it also supports Mercurial (another version control system, though support for it is now deprecated). Bitbucket is often used for private repositories and is a popular choice for teams using Atlassian tools (like Jira or Trello).
  * **How it works**: Like GitHub, you can host Git repositories on Bitbucket, push your code to it, and collaborate with others. Bitbucket also provides features like pull requests, continuous integration, and project management tools integrated with other Atlassian services.
