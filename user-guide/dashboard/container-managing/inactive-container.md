# Inactive Container

## **Container Auto-Inactivation and Deletion** <a href="#container-auto-inactivation-and-deletion" id="container-auto-inactivation-and-deletion"></a>

Your container will automatically enter an inactive state under the following circumstances:

* **One month of inactivity:** If the container has not been used for a month, it will be automatically inactivated.
* **Insufficient credits:** For containers that are billed for storage, when credits are exhausted, the container will be automatically inactivated.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Warning**

* **Containers that remain inactive for more than 6 months will be deleted.** You will receive a deletion notification email one month and one week before deletion.
* **Please note that deleted containers cannot be recovered.** If you have important data, please log in to the Dashboard page and click the **\[Reactivate]** button to activate your container.
{% endhint %}

## **If it takes too long to reactivate**

It may take some time if the inactive state period is long or if the container contains a large amount of data. Please try **refreshing** the page or using **Chrome's Incognito mode**.&#x20;
