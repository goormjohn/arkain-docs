# Source Code Management Git

Git, developed by Linus Torvalds in 2005, is the most widely used version control system. As a distributed version control system (DVCS), Git helps manage code changes efficiently and facilitates seamless collaboration in software development.

{% hint style="warning" %}
To use Arkain's distributed version control feature, a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account that supports Git repository hosting is required. GitHub is the most popular Git repository hosting service.
