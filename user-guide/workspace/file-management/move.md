# Move

Move the file/folder to another location. However, if the location is unavailable, it will not be moved, and if there are files/folders with the same name, they may be overwritten or merged.

To move a file/folder, right-click the file/folder you want to move in the project explorer on the left layout of goormIDE and click the **\[Move]** menu.

In the **\[Move File]** pop-up window that appears, select the location to move with the mouse or directional keys and click the **`OK`** button to update the project explorer and move the file/folder.

Alternatively, drag the files/folders you want to move and drop them where you want to move them.

If you move a file that is already open in the workspace, the editor will close and reopen. If you are in an editing state, you can choose to save or not.
