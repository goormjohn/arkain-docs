# Code Supporter

### Code Supporter

Code Supporter helps you write and fix code more easily and accurately. You can enable this feature when you **create** or **start** a container.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Currently, this feature is available for **JavaScript** and **TypeScript**. Support for additional language will be rolled out gradually.
{% endhint %}

***

### Key Features

* **Go to Definition**: <kbd>Cmd</kbd>/<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + Click on a function, variable, etc. to go directly to where it’s declared.
* **Hover Info**: Hover over a symbol to see its type, description, and documentation.
* **Autocomplete Suggestions**: When you type or after trigger characters (e.g. `.`), suggestions appear; pick one and it inserts code for you.
* **Live Diagnostics**: Errors and warnings show up in your code immediately — underlined or marked.

### How to Enable

You can enable the Code Supporter feature when you create a container, based on your requirements. [creating-container](../../dashboard/container/container-management/creating-container/ "mention")

Similarly, when creating a container through **Templates**, you can enable the Code Supporter feature.&#x20;

Additionally, you can enable or disable the feature of an existing container on the **Container Settings page** at any time, depending on your needs and purposes. [container-settings](../../dashboard/container/container-management/container-settings/ "mention")
