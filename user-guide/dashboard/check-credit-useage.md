### How to calculate credit usage.

* Credit will be deducted when the container is terminated.
* If a container is in use and terminates with no credits remaining, the value of credits shown on the Usage page might be greater than the actual value deducted because the time when credits are deducted and the time when the container actually terminates might be different.
