### **1. Browser Settings:**

We recommend using Arkain with Firefox browser.

If you use Chrome browser, folders and files may not be created.
```

### **2. Android (Galaxy) Keyboard Settings:**

* Turn off \*\*Settings - General - Samsung Keyboard Settings - Smart Input - Phrase Suggestions \*\*in your device setting. If the phrase suggestion is activated, the enter input may be distorted during editing.
* Set to floating keyboard with **Settings - General - Samsung Keyboard Settings - Mode - Portrait Screen / Landscape Screen** in your device setting. This will make the keyboard not to cover your editor screen.
