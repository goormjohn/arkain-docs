<summary>Membership terms</summary>

This policy forms part of the Arkain Service Terms and Conditions and is subject to the terms and conditions of the Arkain Service Terms and Conditions if not specified in this policy.

Members are deemed to have agreed to a one-month/one-year periodic automatic payment agreement by paying for their Arkain membership. The amount used in the following payment cycle will be charged to the registered payment method.

Members can withdraw their subscription within 7 days from the date of subscription, provided that the credits received as a membership benefit have not been used. However, if the contents of the contract are different from the contents indicated or advertised by the company or are implemented differently from the contents of the contract, the subscription can be withdrawn within one month from the date of subscription, or within 14 days from the date of knowing or knowing the fact.\
The refund amount will be calculated based on the following formulas.\
Used Amount = (Total Billed Amount / Number of days in subscription period) x (Number of days elapsed since the Subscription Billing Date)\
Refund Amount = Total Billed Amount - Used Amount\
Calculation Basis:\
The number of days in the subscription period is calculated as 365 days for annual subscriptions and 30.5 days for monthly subscriptions.

Members may cancel the automatic renewal of their subscription agreement at any time, following the instructions provided online. If the member chooses to cancel the automatic renewal during the subscription contract period, the member can use the service for the remainder of the contract.

Arkain may offer membership subscription benefits based on promotion or members' activities, and the terms and details of the membership offer will be announced separately through Arkain.

If the member's use of the service is restricted or leaves the member due to reasons attributable to the member, such as the terms of use, the subscription contract will be canceled, and repayment and compensation for the canceled subscription cannot be requested.

Members cannot transfer membership subscription agreements to other members.

If you paid for your membership with a card, then canceling a payment will cancel to the card you paid with.
