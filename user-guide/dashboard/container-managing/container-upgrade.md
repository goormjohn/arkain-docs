# Container Upgrade

## ðŸš€ Container **Performance and Storage Management**

Arkain provides flexible options to enhance container performance and storage capacity. Here's how you can manage these features:

***

### **âš¡ Upgrade Container Performance**

* You can **boost your containerâ€™s resources** (such as CPU and memory) directly from the **settings page**.
* Upgrading performance is ideal for handling larger workloads or improving application efficiency.

<table><thead><tr><th>Type</th><th>Specification</th><th width="188">Credits per hour</th><th>Price</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Micro</td><td>0.5 vCPU, 1GB Memory</td><td>2.25</td><td>$0.045</td></tr><tr><td>Small</td><td>2 vCPU, 2GB Memory</td><td>5.25</td><td>$0.105</td></tr><tr><td>Medium</td><td>4 vCPU, 4GB Memory</td><td>9.75</td><td>$0.195</td></tr><tr><td>Large</td><td>8 vCPU, 8GB Memory</td><td>18.75</td><td>$0.375</td></tr><tr><td>GPU Basic</td><td>3.5 vCPU, 13GB Memory</td><td><del>17.25</del> â†’ 13.2</td><td><del>$0.345</del> â†’ $0.264</td></tr></tbody></table>

## **ðŸ’¾ Add Container Storage**

* **Expand Your Storage**: Increase the storage capacity of your container when needed, ensuring you have enough space for your projects and files.
* **Important Note**: Once storage is increased, it **cannot be reduced**. Plan your storage upgrades carefully to avoid unnecessary allocations.
* **Membership Requirement**: Storage upgrades are only available for users with a **membership plan**.
