The revised policy will take effect on **February 12, 2026**.

#### Key Changes

* **Service Security Enhancement:** Introduction of one-way Hashed Information (non-recoverable) to prevent duplicate account creation and ensure system stability.
* **Secure Data Management:** Hashed data will be securely retained for one year after account deletion or blocking to maintain a safe and stable service environment.
