# Make a WEB with Open API

To access the **\[Make a WEB with Open API]** template, you must issue the required API KEY.

## How do I obtain an OpenWeatherMap API Key?

1. Go to [https://openweathermap.org/](https://openweathermap.org/) and sign up.

5. Copy the issued Key.
6. The preparation is complete, but you need to wait for the API to be approved. According to the email you received when the API was issued, it may take several hours for it to be approved. Since you will not receive a separate approval email or notification, we recommend that you wait a day or so before accessing it.
