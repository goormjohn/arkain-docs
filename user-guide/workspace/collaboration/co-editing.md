# Co-Editing

Users who receive access to the container can open the same file and edit code simultaneously.

If another user is viewing the same file, a green indicator appears on the left side of the file tab. Additionally, the name of that user is displayed at the cursor position, allowing real-time tracking of the editing information.

If you prefer not to see the cursor of other users, you can uncheck the **`[Project] > [Toggle Cursor Sharing]`** option in the top Menu.
