## How Credits Are Calculated

This is a forecasting tool that provides an approximate cost based on your specified project or usage. However, the forecasted cost may differ from the actual cost due to various factors:

* **Duration**\
  Assumes **720 hours** per month and does not account for leap years.&#x20;
* **Promotional Credits**\
  Does not include promotional credits or discounts.
* **Additional Charges**\
  Does not account for additional usage not included in the forecast (e.g., if you use more than **5GB** of storage on the Free plan, you pay **0.018 credits** per GB per hour).&#x20;
* **Currency**\
  Forecasts are based on a fixed exchange rate.
