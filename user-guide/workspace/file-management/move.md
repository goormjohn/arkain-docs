# Move

Move the file/folder to another location. If there are files/folders with the same name, they may be overwritten.

To move a file/folder, right-click the desired file or folder in the Project Sidebar of Arkain and click the **\[Move]** menu.

In the **Move file** popup, select the destination and click the **\[OK]** button to move the file or folder. You can also move it by dragging and dropping it with the mouse.

If you move a file that is already open in the workspace, the editor will close and reopen. If you are in an editing state, you can choose to save or not.
