This Service may include subscription-based plans with recurring charges ("Membership"). The "Subscription Billing Date" refers to the date the subscription is first purchased. The subscription begins on the billing date and continues for the selected subscription period ("Initial Subscription Period"). It automatically renews for the same period (collectively, "Subscription Period") unless canceled by the user or terminated by us.

By activating the subscription, users authorize us or the third-party payment processor to charge all recurring fees until the subscription is canceled. Information regarding "Subscription Fees" can be found on our pricing page. Fees will be automatically charged on the billing date and for each renewal period, including applicable taxes. To avoid charges for the next period, users must cancel before the renewal date through the billing menu or by contacting us at \[contact@arkain.io]. Cancellation requests must be received before the renewal date to avoid charges for the next subscription period.

Members are deemed to have agreed to a one-month or one-year periodic automatic payment agreement by paying for their Arkain membership. The amount used in the following payment cycle will be charged to the registered payment method.

Members can withdraw their subscription within 7 days from the date of subscription (“Withdrawal Period”), provided that the credits received as a membership benefit have not been used. However, if the contents of the contract are different from the contents indicated or advertised by the company or are implemented differently from the contents of the contract, the Withdrawal Period shall be three months from the date of subscription, or within 30 days from the date of knowing or knowing the fact.

After the Withdrawal Period has passed, Members may withdraw their subscription at any time, in which case the Company shall refund the remaining amount after deducting the fee for the elapsed period and a cancellation penalty (Deposit) equivalent to 10% of the remaining amount, regardless of the user's service usage history.

The refund amount will be calculated based on the following formulas.

●      Used Amount = (Total Billed Amount / Number of days in subscription period) x (Number of days elapsed since the Subscription Billing Date up to the cancellation request date)

●      Deposit = 0.1 x (Total Billed Amount - Used Amount)

If the Member has withdrawn their subscription within the Withdrawal Period, the Deposit shall be zero.

●      Refund Amount = Ceiling (Total Billed Amount - Used Amount – Deposit)

The final Refund Amount will be rounded up to the nearest whole number (Ceiling) if it includes a decimal.

●      Calculation Basis: The number of days in the subscription period is calculated as 365 days for annual subscriptions and 30.5 days for monthly subscriptions.

Members may cancel the automatic renewal of their subscription agreement at any time, following the instructions provided online. If the member chooses to cancel the automatic renewal during the subscription contract period, the member can use the service for the remainder of the contract.

Arkain may offer membership subscription benefits based on promotion or members' activities, and the terms and details of the membership offer will be announced separately through Arkain.

Members cannot transfer membership subscription agreements to other members.

If you paid for your membership with a card, then canceling a payment will cancel to the card you paid with. If a refund to the original payment method is impossible due to unavoidable circumstances (such as limitations of the card company's system), the refund will be processed through an alternative method.
