### **Total Usage**

Displays the total amount of credits deducted during the current month.

### **Per resource**

Breaks down credit deduction based on resource types:

* **Container usage**: Credits deducted for running containers.
* **Storage**: Credits deducted for storage capacity allocated to the container.
* **Traffic**: Credits deducted for data transfer and traffic.
* **AI**: Credits deducted for AI features such as the Arkain Snap and the Side Chat.



### Container Usage

Displays detailed credit logs for each container on a selected date. Check the logs by changing the date by day. You can view the resource usage that led to container credit deductions.

Hover over the info icon to see information on your container's advanced features at the time of credit deduction.

**How to calculate credit usage**

* Credit will be deducted when the container is terminated.
* If a container is in use and terminates with no credits remaining, the value of credits shown on the Usage page might be greater than the actual value deducted because the time when credits are deducted and the time when the container actually terminates might be different.
{% endhint %}

### &#x20;AI Usage

Displays detailed credit logs for AI feature usage. You can browse the logs by switching pages, and view the Type and Container associated with each usage log.&#x20;

Types include **AI Supporter**, **Chat(Side Chat)**, and **Arkain Snap.**&#x20;

Information on LLMs is shown only for the **Chat** type, and not for the other types.
