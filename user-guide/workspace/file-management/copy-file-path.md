# Copy File Path

The **Copy File Path** feature allows you to quickly copy the relative or absolute path of a file or folder in your project.



To copy a relative path, right-click the file or folder in the Project Sidebar and select the **\[Copy Path]**. The relative path will be copied to your clipboard. This path always begins with the project name, making it suitable for use within the project workspace.

If you need the full system path, right-click the file or folder and select the **\[Copy Absolute Path]**. This will copy the complete path starting from `/workspace`, ensuring you have the exact location on your system.



Both options make it easier to reference files in your project configuration, documentation, or code.
