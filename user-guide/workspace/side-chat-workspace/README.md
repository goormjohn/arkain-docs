# Side Chat (Workspace)

The **Side Chat** feature in **Arkain** allows you to interact with powerful LLMs (Large Language Models) directly within your development environment. You can ask questions about your code, get real-time assistance, and track your interactions with the chat history feature. Here's how to make the most of it:

***

## **Getting Started with Side Chat**

* Open Side Chat from the Sidebar in the Workspace.
* Side Chat supports a range of LLMs([Supported Models](../../arkain-ai/supported-models.md)).
* Side Chat maintains context within a single session, ensuring the LLM remembers previous interactions for seamless conversations.

## Ask a question in Side Chat

* Type your question in the chat box. Examples include:
  * _"What’s wrong with this function? Here’s the code: ..."_
  * _"Can you optimize this SQL query?"_
  * _"What does this error mean in Python?"_

## **Add Context**: Elevate Side Chat with Project Files and Images

### Adding Project Files

Click  the **\[Add context]** button to feed relevant files from your project directly into Side Chat.

You can quickly include:

* **Your 5 Most Recently Opened Files**, instantly accessible
* **Any File via Project-Wide Search**, by name or path

This eliminates manual copy-pasting—Side Chat immediately gains visibility into your actual work, delivering sharper, context-aware responses.

### Adding Images

Click the **\[Upload Images]** button or drag and drop images directly into Side Chat to provide visual context. The LLM will automatically analyze and understand the image content to enhance its responses.

Image Upload Details:

* Supports common image formats: JPG, PNG, SVG, and more
* Add up to 5 images per message (separate from file attachments)
* Maximum file size: 20MB per image
* Large images are automatically compressed during upload.
* Uploaded images are saved within your project folder, and you can freely upload images within the container's storage capacity.

This feature is particularly useful for analyzing UI designs or mockups, or  for debugging visual rendering issues.

## **Managing Chat History**

### **Persistent Chat History**

All your conversations in Side Chat are saved under **\[History]**. You can revisit past sessions to review previous answers or refer back to specific code solutions.

### Delete Chat History

Click the **\[History]** button at the top left of Side Chat. When you hover your mouse over the chat history list, a trash can icon will appear.&#x20;

Click the trash can icon to delete the saved chat history.

## **Tips for Efficient Use**

* **Be Specific**\
  Provide clear and concise questions to get accurate and relevant answers.
* **Share Relevant Code**\
  Paste snippets or files directly into the chat for more contextual responses.
* **Utilize History**\
  Review past sessions to avoid redundant queries and improve your workflow.
