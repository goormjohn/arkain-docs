# Auto-completion

The **Auto-completion** feature is a convenient function that recommends code based on the user's input using gpt-4.1-mini-based AI, which can be immediately applied in the editor.

### Key features <a href="#key-features" id="key-features"></a>

* **Real-time code completion**\
  As you type, AI predicts the next code to be entered and automatically completes it for you.
* **Support for various programming languages**\
  It supports a wide range of languages, including Python, JavaScript, and Java, for your convenience.

### How to Set Up the Feature <a href="#how-to-set-up-the-feature" id="how-to-set-up-the-feature"></a>

* Clicking the **\[Auto completion]** button at the bottom right of the workspace toggles the feature on or off. When the feature is enabled, the **\[Auto completion]** button appears purple.
