# Rename the Container

Arkain allows you to rename your containers for better organization and clarity.

Click the **\[Settings]** button (![](../../../../../.gitbook/assets/setting.svg)) of the container card you want to rename on the Dashboard page. On the Container Settings page, click the **\[Edit]** button (![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/edit (2).svg>)) at the top-left corner.

#### Step-by-Step

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
Enter the new name for the container. The name must be unique within your workspace and follow standard naming conventions (alphabets, numbers, hyphens, and underscores).
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Click the **\[Save]** button to rename the container.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}



#### **Rename the Container**

* You can **rename your container** at any time from the **Container** **Settings page.**
* Renaming is useful for improving container identification, especially when managing multiple containers or evolving project scopes.

{% hint style="warning" %}
- Only the container **owner** can rename the container.
- Containers can be renamed while running, but the editor will refresh right after, which may clear unsaved edits.
{% endhint %}
