# Key Terms

## **General Terminology**

### **Container**

A **Container** refers to a cloud-hosted Virtual Machine (VM) that serves as a development environment owned by the user. It is the primary unit where coding, testing, and debugging occur.

### **Templates**

The **Templates** consist of example files and pre-installed software packages that are automatically generated within a container. You can use these templates to quickly start a new project with the necessary configurations.

### **Workspace**

The **Workspace** is the IDE(Integrated Development Environment) where developers create and manage their projects. It includes various development tools and utilities for efficient project development.

### **Credits**

**Credits** are the virtual currency required to use containers. As you utilize your container and AI features, credits are deducted accordingly.

### **Membership**&#x20;

**Membership** refers to Arkain's paid plan designed for users who want to create large projects with enhanced features and advanced benefits compared to the Free Plan.

## **Workspace Elements**

### Arkain Snap

**Arkain Snap** is an AI assistant that turns ideas into reality. Using just natural language, it automates the initial setup of container development environments, and for simple ideas, it creates prototypes just by making a request.

### Auto-stop

**Auto-stop** shuts down containers after 30-40 minutes when the container's owner closes all Workspace browsers. This feature prevents unnecessary credit use and allows you to use the service more efficiently.

### **Menu**

The **Menu**, located at the top of the Workspace, provides access to container information and various container settings. It allows users to configure their container environment.

### **Sidebar**

The **Sidebar** is located on the left side of the Workspace, contains various development tools, including a file tree for easy project management and the Search feature for searching across the entire project.

### **Editor**

The **Editor**, located in the center of the Workspace, is where you can view and edit files. It features tabs for files, preview windows, terminal sessions, and more.

### Toggle Panel

The **Toggle Panel**, located below the editor, displays the terminal.

### Side Chat

The **Side Chat** feature in **Arkain** allows you to interact with powerful LLMs (Large Language Models) directly within your development environment. You can ask questions about your code, get real-time assistance, and track your interactions with the chat history feature.

### AI Supporter

The **AI Supporter** is an intelligent assistance layer that learns project-specific context—code structure, dependencies, configurations—and empowers Side Chat with enhanced, contextually accurate responses. It works in the background to boost Side Chat’s effectiveness and adapts as the project evolves.

### Code Supporter

The **Code Supporter** is a feature that helps you write and fix code more easily and accurately by providing intelligent, real-time assistance. It works in the background to deliver features like Go to Definition, Autocomplete Suggestions, and Live Diagnostics, enabling you to improve code quality without leaving your editor.
