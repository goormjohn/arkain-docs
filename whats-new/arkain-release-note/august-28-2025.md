*   **Overall UI Enhancements**

    Improved the UI across Workspace, Code Editor, Search, Command Config, Preference, Collaboration, Code Apply results, and Context Menu. The design has been refined to deliver a more consistent and intuitive user experience.

## New Features

* Ubuntu 22.04 LTS is now available for the GPU stack.
* You can now receive a notification 1 minute before your GPU container is terminated due to insufficient cloud resources.
* When adding files, the \[Add Context] button now lets you search and select from any file in your project.

## **Changes**

#### Dashboard

* The container creation completion popup no longer appears when creating a container with Arkain Snap on the Dashboard page.
* You can now search templates by description and introduction, in addition to name and stack.

#### Workspace

* The ‘Search All’ feature has been moved from the Toggle panel to the Sidebar and its default shortcut has been changed from `Alt + H` to `Ctrl + Shift + F`.
* The Preferences page now appears directly within the Editor section, instead of as a popup.

## Bug Fixes

#### Snap & Container Management

* Fixed the bug where Arkain Snap on the Dashboard page did not work properly when the prompt length exceeded a certain limit.

#### Workspace

* Fixed the bug where commands would not be re-executed when the \[Execute Command] button was clicked repeatedly.
* Fixed the bug where the \[Apply] button for codes in SideChat would remain disabled in some cases.

#### UI & Platforms
