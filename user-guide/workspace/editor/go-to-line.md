# Go to Line

In Arkainâ€™s editor, you can quickly move to a specific line using the **Go to Line** feature.

The **Go to Line** feaure allows you to jump directly to a line number by moving both the cursor and the visible screen to that position.

To use this feature, right-click inside the editor and select **\[Go to Line]**. An input field will appear where you can enter the desired line number. Alternatively, press the default shortcut <kbd>**Alt**</kbd>**&#x20;+&#x20;**<kbd>**Ctrl**</kbd>**&#x20;+&#x20;**<kbd>**G**</kbd> or <kbd>**Cmd**</kbd> **+&#x20;**<kbd>**F**</kbd> (Mac) to open the input field.

After entering the line number, press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to confirm. The editor will immediately move the cursor and view to the specified line.
