# Split Workspace

In Arkain’s editor, you can view multiple files side by side using the **Split Workspace** feature.

The **Split Workspace** feature allows you to divide the editor into multiple panes to work on several files at the same time.

There are two ways to split the Workspace:

### Drag and Drop

1. Drag an editor tab and drop it into the desired position.
2. A purple highlight will appear, showing where the tab will be placed.
3. You can split the Workspace in any direction—top, bottom, left, or right.

### Click the Split button

1. Click the **Split** button at the top right corner of the editor.
2. This creates a new split group to the right of the current one.



If all editors are closed, the default **Welcome screen** will appear. From here, you can right-click and select **\[Split Right]** or **\[Split Down]** to add a new split group to the Workspace.
