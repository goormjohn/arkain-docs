# AI Supporter

The **AI Supporter** is a background enhancement feature that learns from your project to elevate the quality of **Side Chat**’s responses. By assimilating your project's context—such as codebase, configuration, and structure—it enables more precise, relevant, and context-aware assistance.

If the container is already created:

1. Go to the **Container Settings** page by clicking the **\[Settings]** button(<img src="../../.gitbook/assets/ActivityBar-item-10 (2).png" alt="" data-size="line">) in the Container Card.
2. In the **Container Status** section, enable the **AI Supporter** feature. Make sure the container is **stopped** before you enable it.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Warning**

The cost for using the advanced features such as **AI Supporter and Code Supporter** is added to your container cost. However, when using a GPU container, there is no additional charge for these features; instead, your allocated **GPU compute and memory resources** will be reduced.
