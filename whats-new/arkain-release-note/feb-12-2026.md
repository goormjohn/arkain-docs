#### **Minor Changes**

**Changes**

* **Automated Billing Retry:** The system now automatically retries failed credit deductions when a container is stopped.
* **Design System Update:** Upgraded our design system to a new version, introducing subtle visual refinements across the platform for a more consistent and polished experience.
* **Entry-Level Support:** Added a \[Contact Us] button to the login and sign-up pages for immediate support access.
* **Signup Security Update:** To ensure service stability, we now preserve hashing values for accounts blocked due to policy violations, preventing re-registration.
* **Age-Verified Onboarding:** Added a birthdate collection step during signup to comply with our policy where users under 16 are restricted from registration.
