## 🌟 Precision, Control, and Seamless Workflow

We are committed to providing a development environment that is not only powerful but also intuitive. This update brings smarter navigation, enhanced mobile accessibility, and finer control over your workspace.

#### New Features

**🔍 In-Terminal Search (Ctrl + F / Cmd ⌘ + F)**\
Stop wasting time scrolling through endless logs. You can now search for specific words or strings directly within the terminal using Ctrl + F (or Cmd ⌘ + F on macOS). This allows for near-instant log analysis and faster debugging.

#### Changes

**🐍 Modern Python Standard (python3)**\
The default `python` command is now updated to **python3**, ensuring your environment aligns with modern development practices right out of the box.

**⚡ Intelligent File Navigation**\
The **File Finder** now intelligently prioritizes your most recently accessed files, letting you resume your workflow in a split second.

**🛡️ Granular Privacy Control**\
New **Service Cookie Consent** settings are now available in the Account page and Workspace, allowing you to selectively manage exactly which data you share.

#### Deprecations

* **Git Ignore Management:** Removed the \[Ignore List] pop-up; please use a `.gitignore` file directly in your project.
*   **Legacy Model Cleanup:** To focus our resources on peak performance and cutting-edge AI, we have deprecated several legacy models:

    * **GPT Series:** gpt-5.1, gpt-5, gpt-4.1, gpt-4.1-mini, gpt-o4-mini, gpt-o4-mini-high, gpt-o3
    * **Others:** gemini-2.5-pro, claude-3.5-sonnet
