# Pull

Click the **\[Pull]** button in the top-right corner of the Git Sidebar. After a few seconds, the Project Sidebar will refresh and the repository will be updated with the latest revision.

If there are any conflicts between the existing files and the new version, you will see the conflict history on the right.
