# Auto-off

**Auto-off** shuts down containers after 30-40 minutes when the container's owner closes all Workspace browsers. This feature prevents unnecessary credit use and allows you to use the service more efficiently.

## Feature Guide <a href="#feature-guide" id="feature-guide"></a>

When **Auto-off** is **On**;

* **Auto-off**: The container will automatically shut down 30-40 minutes after all browsers are closed. No credits are deducted after that.
* **Owner-based**: The container owner must close all browsers for **Auto-off** to occur. If you are only using it as a guest, owner should turn off **Auto-off**.
* **Background run**: If you want to keep container running in the background (always-on), you must turn off **Auto-off**.

When **Auto-off** is **Off**;

* **Manual Exit** (stop): The container will continue to run even if you close only browsers. Please manually stop the container by clicking the **\[Container Exit]** button located in the Workspace or the **\[Stop]** button located in the dashboard.
* **Credit use**: If you do not manually stop the container, it will continue to deduct credits. To avoid unnecessary credit use, be sure to exit and stop the container.

**NOTE**\
The **Auto-off** feature works based on all browsers of the container owner being closed. Be sure to turn off **Auto-off** when using guest accounts or background run.
