### **1. This Month's Usage**

* Displays the total amount of credits consumed during the current month.

### **2. Resource Usage by Type**

* Breaks down credit consumption based on resource types:
  * **Container Usage**: Credits used for running containers.
  * **Storage Usage**: Credits consumed for storing data.
  * **Traffic Usage**: Credits used for data transfer and traffic.

### **3. Usage by Owned Containers**

* Shows detailed credit usage for each container you own, making it easy to identify which containers are using the most resources.

### How to calculate credit usage.

* Credit will be deducted when the container is terminated.
* If a container is in use and terminates with no credits remaining, the value of credits shown on the Usage page might be greater than the actual value deducted because the time when credits are deducted and the time when the container actually terminates might be different.
