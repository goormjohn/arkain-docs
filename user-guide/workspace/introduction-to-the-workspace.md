# Introduction to the Workspace

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Running a container that includes a single development environment allows you to focus on development in the cloud workspace without the complex configurations.

The workspace represents an IDE working space where you can develop projects, including powerful tools for editing, building, and supporting development tasks.

### **Create a Container** <a href="#create-a-container" id="create-a-container"></a>

A container refers to a virtual machine(VM) containing a single development environment. Changes made within the container are stored in the cloud environment, allowing you to run the container from anywhere and continue development in the same environment.

Containers can be created in just 1 minute. Check out the [Quickstart](https://mkdocs-mxedr.run.goorm.site/Getting-Started/Quickstart/#h.1607vphfqgbb) documentation to get started!

### **Run your code** <a href="#run-your-code" id="run-your-code"></a>

To run your code, click the `Run` button in the top-right corner of the workspace, or manually enter the run scripts in the terminal. Also you can customize the scripts of the `Run` button. To learn how to customize the Run command, please check [here](https://mkdocs-mxedr.run.goorm.site/03.-Workspace/Introduction-to-the-Workspace/?tab=t.0#heading=h.j24pgksoug5j).

### Check the output <a href="#check-the-output" id="check-the-output"></a>

The results of code can be viewed in the panel at the bottom of the workspace. If you're developing web applications, you can use the provided domain to check the code output in your browser. Learn how to create and manage domains [here](https://mkdocs-mxedr.run.goorm.site/03.-Workspace/Introduction-to-the-Workspace/?tab=t.0#heading=h.bw4rcvqqd3rp).
