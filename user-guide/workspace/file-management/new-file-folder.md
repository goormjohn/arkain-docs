# New File / Folder

The **New File and New Folder** features allow you to add items directly into the **Project Sidebar**.



There are two ways to create a new file or folder:

### Clicking the \[+] button

1. Select the location in the Project Sidebar where you want the item to appear.
2. Click the \[+] icon at the top in the Project Sidebar.
3. Select **\[New File]** or **\[New Folder]**.

### Using Right-clicking

1. Right-click on any sub project or folder in the Project Sidebar.
2. Select **\[New File]** or **\[New Folder].**



An input field will appear at the currently selected location in the Project Sidebar. Enter the desired name and press Enter to confirm. This will create the new item within the chosen location.

{% hint style="warning" %}
* The file or folder names must only contain alphabets, numbers, and approved special characters such as underscores (\_), and hyphens (-).
* The name must be unique within your project.
{% endhint %}



When you create a new file, an editor for that file will automatically open in the Workspace, allowing you to start editing immediately. New folders are added directly to the selected location and can be used to organize your files.
