***

### **Upgrade Container Performance**

* You can **boost your containerâ€™s resources** (such as CPU and memory) directly from the **settings page**.
* Upgrading performance is ideal for handling larger workloads or improving application efficiency.
* A containerâ€™s resources (such as CPU and memory) can only be modified when the container is in a stopped state, and its performance can be increased or decreased as needed at any time.

## **Add Container Storage**

* **Expand Your Storage**: Increase the storage capacity of your container when needed, ensuring you have enough space for your projects and files.
* **Important Note**: Once a container's storage capacity is increased, it **cannot be reduced**. Plan your storage upgrades carefully to avoid unnecessary allocations.
* **Membership Requirement**: Storage upgrades are only available for users with a **membership plan**.
