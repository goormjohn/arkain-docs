Get full access to Arkain's powerful features and explore a variety of LLMs with our exclusive Beta Membership—available only for the first time during the initial beta period. This membership will automatically update daily at UTC 2:30 after you join. It's temporary and will end when Arkain officially launches. We'll give you plenty of notice before the transition.
