# Container

Arkain provides **container**, which is isolated environments that package everything needed to run software (code, libraries, configuration files, etc.) into a single package.

A **stack** is a pre-configured software package that is installed by default in a container. Each container has a single stack, but users can install additional software based on their project requirements.
