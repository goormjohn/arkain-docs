{% hint style="warning" %}
**Vibe coding** is an AI-dependent computer programming practice where programmers engage in pair programming with an LLM. The code writing is handled by the LLM, and the user creates the program by interacting with the LLM through natural language prompts. With this approach, even people without programming knowledge can create the services or apps they need.
