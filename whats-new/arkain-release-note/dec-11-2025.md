### New Features

**🚀 Ubuntu 24.04 LTS Now Available**

Step up to the latest and most stable **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS OS version**. This upgrade gives you access to the newest features, enhanced performance, and robust security, ensuring your development environment is ready for tomorrow's challenges. Start building with the cutting edge, today.

**🔔 Quick Access to Notices**

Check important announcements instantly with the new **Notice shortcut** in your Dashboard sidebar.

**📱 Mark All Notifications as Read**

A new **\[Read all]** button in mobile view lets you clear notifications with a single tap.

### Changes

**💰 Clearer Usage View: GB Replaces MBs**

Your storage usage on the Credit usage page is now displayed in GB, reflecting the actual scale of overages. This gives you a clearer, more transparent view of your resource tracking and costs.

**🛠️ Upgrade Clarity: Clear Feedback on Storage Attempts**

We’ve added crystal-clear error messaging if you attempt an additional storage upgrade too soon (within 6 hours). This prevents confusing timeouts or silent failures by telling you exactly why the attempt was blocked, ensuring you try again at the right time.

**🖱️ Work the Way You Want: Resizable Split Panels Are Here**

Take control of your workspace layout! Easily adjust split panels by dragging the divider, or double-click it to instantly set panels to equal size. Customize your screen for maximum comfort and perfectly balance your editor and views.

**💡 Instant Code Fixes: Diff Viewer Jumps You to the Exact Line**

Moving from Git Diff review to editing has never been smoother. When you click "Open File" from the Diff Viewer, the editor now opens the file precisely at the cursor position you were viewing. Say goodbye to scrolling and hello to instant context.

**🏷️ Organize and Find Files Faster: Tagging is Now a Lightning-Fast Experience**

We've polished the File Tagging interface (UI/UX), making it dramatically easier to use with improved search functionality and keyboard navigation.

**🛡️ Security Upgrade: Continuous Threat Protection and Monitoring**

We are continuously enhancing our automated, real-time security systems to monitor and block malicious software that could compromise system performance. Rest assured, our investment in advanced detection tools means your environment is reliably protected.

### **Improvements & Quality of Life Fixes**

We've polished several aspects of your experience to ensure everything runs smoothly and reliably, eliminating minor friction points.

* **Sharing Permissions Fixed:** Resolved a container sharing bug where users were incorrectly invited with Read-only permission only. Sharing now works as intended with proper access rights.
* **Loading State Clarity:** Fixed a persistent loading state that incorrectly displayed even after container inactivation was complete, ensuring accurate status updates.
* **GPU Log Consistency:** Resolved inconsistencies in container specification information across your Credit usage page and deduction logs when using GPU containers.
* **Accurate Billing Data:** Fixed a bug where container spec information for deleted containers was displayed incorrectly on the Credit usage page, ensuring accurate usage history.
* **Template Comment Accuracy:** Synchronized comment counts between the Template Community and Detail pages for consistent browsing.
* **Full Terminal View:** Fixed a terminal display issue where the terminal window was partially cut off.
* **Real-Time Context:** Fixed a real-time update failure where the file list wouldn't refresh when searching for files while interacting in the Side Chat, keeping your context seamless.
* **Enhanced File Handling:** You can now open large image files (over 4MB) directly in the **Image Viewer**, instead of the terminal.
* **Faster AI Sync:** File changes made by Claude Code are now immediately reflected in the editor, ensuring real-time synchronization with your AI pair programmer.

### **Deprecated**
