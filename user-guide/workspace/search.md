# Search

The **\[Search]** button opens the Search Sidebar area.

Enter a keyword in the input field at the top to view all matching results, grouped by file. This is useful when searching across your entire project.\
Each result displays the file name, line number, and matching content. You can quickly jump to the relevant location by clicking the matching result.

Additionally, you can search within a specific folder. In the **Project Sidebar**, right-click the desired folder and select **\[Find in This Directory]**. The search will then be limited to that folder and its subdirectories.
