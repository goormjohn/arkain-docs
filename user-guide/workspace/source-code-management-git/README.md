# Source Code Management Git

Arkain supports **GitHub**, **Bitbucket**, and **Git** as remote repositories.

*   **Git**:

    Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) that allows multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each otherâ€™s work. It tracks changes in your code, enabling you to revert to previous versions, merge changes, and collaborate more efficiently.
*   **GitHub**:

    GitHub is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories. It provides a web interface to work with Git repositories and includes additional features like issue tracking, project management tools, and pull requests to collaborate on code. It also offers social features like following other developers and starring repositories.
*   **Bitbucket**:

    Bitbucket is another platform that offers Git repository hosting, but it also supports Mercurial (another version control system, though support for it is now deprecated). Bitbucket is often used for private repositories and is a popular choice for teams using Atlassian tools (like Jira or Trello).
