### How Rewards are Split

Rewards are issued in two stages to both the Referrer (You) and the Referred Friend.

#### Step 1. Friend Signs Up

When a friend joins Arkain using your link or enters your code manually:

* Friend: +300 credits (Issued instantly)
* You: +300 credits (Issued instantly)

#### Step 2. First Credit Purchase ($10 or more)

When your friend makes their first credit purchase of $10 or more:

* Friend: +600 credits
* You: +600 credits
* Note: These rewards are issued after a 7-day confirmation period. Please note that the first transaction must be at least $10 to qualify for the reward.

### FAQ

**Q.** Can I enter a referral code after I've already signed up?\
: No. Referral codes must be applied during the signup process. Our system does not support adding codes to existing accounts.

**Q.** My friend entered my code, but it says "Invalid Code."\
: This occurs if the code is mistyped, the 10-friend limit has been reached, or the referrer’s account is inactive.

**Q.** My friend made a purchase; why didn't I receive the 600 credits yet?\
: There are two main requirements:

1. The first purchase must be $10 or more in a single transaction.
2. There is a 7-day confirmation period after the transaction. If both conditions are met, please check your Billing page after 7 days.
