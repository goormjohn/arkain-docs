# Add

When you add or modify a file/folder, it is automatically added to **Unstaged files**.

Click the **\[+]** icon next to Unstaged files to change the file status from unstaged to staged. Clicking the **\[-]** icon in the Staged file will change the file status to Unstaged.&#x20;

You can also delete individual files or all files in that state by clicking the **trash can icon**.
