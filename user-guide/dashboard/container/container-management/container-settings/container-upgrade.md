### Container **Performance and Storage Management**

Arkain provides flexible options to enhance container performance and storage capacity. Here's how you can manage these features:

#### **Upgrade Container Performance** [container-performance.md](../../container-performance.md "mention")

* You can **boost your container’s resources** (such as CPU and memory) directly on the **Container Settings page**.
* Upgrading performance is ideal for handling larger workloads or improving application efficiency.
* A container’s resources (such as CPU and memory) can only be modified when the container is in a stopped state, and its performance can be increased or decreased as needed at any time.

### **Add Container Storage**

* **Expand Your Storage**: Increase the storage capacity of your container when needed, ensuring you have enough space for your projects and files.
* You can upgrade the storage **up to 200GB.**
* If you exceed the default storage, additional storage will be charged in credits based on usage.\

{% hint style="danger" %}
Once a container's storage capacity is increased, it **cannot be reduced**. \
Plan your storage upgrades carefully to avoid unnecessary allocations.

### **Additional Traffic Charges**

The container's network traffic is provided for free up to 10GB per month, with charges applied per GB when exceeded.

{% hint style="warning" %}
For every **1GB of traffic**, an additional **8 credits** will be charged.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Monitor your container's performance and storage needs regularly to ensure optimal usage and resource allocation.
