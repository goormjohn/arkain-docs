# Container

**A Container** is a technology that packages everything needed to run software (such as code, libraries, configuration files, etc.) into a single package, allowing it to run in an isolated environment. Containers are similar to **virtual machines (VMs)**, but they are lighter, faster, and use system resources more efficiently.

The **Stack** refers to the pre-configured software package that is installed by default in a container. Each container has a single stack, but users can install additional software based on their project needs.

In Arcane, running a container consumes credits based on the container specifications and container usage time. Credits are the virtual currency required to use containers.
