# Add

When you add or modify a file/folder, it is automatically added to **Unstaged files**.

You can change the status of all or individual files to Staged by clicking the **\[+]** icon on the right side of Unstaged files or each file in that section. Clicking the **\[-]** icon in the Staged file will change the file status to Unstaged.&#x20;

You can also delete individual files or all files in that state by clicking the **trash can icon**.
