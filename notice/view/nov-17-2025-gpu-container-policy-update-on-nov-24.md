# (Nov 17, 2025) GPU Container Policy Update on Nov 24

Hello, this is the Arkain Customer Experience Team.\
We sincerely thank you for your continued support of Arkain.

We would like to inform you of an important update to our [GPU Container](../../user-guide/dashboard/container/nvidia-tesla-t4-gpu-container.md) Policy, aimed at improving service stability and overall performance.

***

### Key Updates to GPU Containers

We are implementing the following changes, effective **Monday, November 24th:**

* **Instance Type Upgrade for Enhanced Stability:**
  * The GPU Container instance type will be changed from Spot to On-demand.
  * This change ensures you can reliably access and utilize your GPU containers whenever you need them, without the risk of sudden interruptions.
* **GPU Container Access Limited to Membership Users:**
  * To support the new On-demand infrastructure and provide a premium experience, GPU Containers will now be exclusively available to Membership Plan Users.
* **Updated Pricing:**
  * With the upgrade to On-Demand instances, the GPU Container usage rate will be 51.76 credits per hour. This adjustment reflects the increased cost of guaranteed and stable resource availability.

### Note on Existing GPU Containers

* **Current Status:** Any GPU containers you have previously created are currently stopped.
* **How to resume:** Starting November 24th, you can run your GPU containers after subscribing to a Membership Plan.
* **Data Backup Support:** Please note that containers that remain inactive for more than 6 months will be deleted. If you require assistance with backing up the data in your currently inactive GPU Container, please contact us via [**Chat**](http://arkain.channel.io) for support.
* [Get started with membership](https://arkain.io/my/dashboard#/billing)
