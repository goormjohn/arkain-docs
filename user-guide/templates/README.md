## **Key Features of the Templates Page**

*   **Create New Template** [create-a-template.md](create-a-template.md "mention")

    You can also create a new template directly from the Templates page.
*   **View All Templates** [browse-templates.md](browse-templates.md "mention")

    This page shows all templates of Arkain users, including templates you have created or registered. Each template displays information such as the template name, stack, and description for quick reference.
*   **View Template Details**

    Click on any template card to view more details, including the software stack, configurations, and additional information. Check out the template creator and template usage.
*   **Communicate with Other Users**

    You can comment on the templates you are looking at. Leave compliments on great templates and give feedback on what you think could be improved.
*   **Explore Profiles of Users**  [community-profile.md](community-profile.md "mention")

    You can browse profiles of users who have created templates, view templates created by specific users, and interact with various developers.
*   **Use Templates** [use-templates.md](use-templates.md "mention")

    If you like the template you're looking at, try creating your own container using the template. The default settings for the container follow the selected template.

{% hint style="info" %}
The template's main folder under the `/workspace` path is renamed to the name of the created container.
{% endhint %}
