# Configuring Container

## **🌐 Arkain Container** Configuring **Guide**

Welcome to Arkain's container settings page! This guide will walk you through all the features and configurations available to help you optimize your development environment. 🚀

***

### 🛠️ **1. Container Basics**

* **Name & Description**\
  Easily rename your container to match your project or team needs. Add a description to provide context for what the container is used for. This is especially helpful for collaboration.

***

### 🚀 &#x32;**. Startup Script**

* Write a custom script that will execute automatically whenever the container starts. Use this to install dependencies, set up services, or perform any initialization tasks.

***

### 🌐 **2. URL & Port Management**

* **Execution URL**\
  View and manage the unique URL for accessing your running application directly from the browser.
* **Port Settings**\
  Configure which ports the container will expose. This is crucial for ensuring your application or services can be accessed externally.

***

### 🔒 **3. Advanced Configuration**

* **SSH Settings**\
  Set up secure shell (SSH) access to your container for remote management or troubleshooting.
* **Port Forwarding**\
  Map external ports to internal ports in your container for seamless communication between services.
* **Environment Variables**\
  Define key-value pairs to control the behavior of your application. Examples include database credentials, API keys, or custom configuration options.

***

### 📦 **4. Templates & Terminal**

* **Save as Template**\
  Create a reusable container template to standardize configurations across projects or teams. Templates save time by predefining settings and environments.
* **Direct Terminal Access**\
  Open a terminal session directly from the settings page to run commands or debug your container without leaving the Arkain interface.

***

### 🚀 **5. Performance Optimization**

* **Upgrade Container Performance**\
  Adjust the resources allocated to your container, such as CPU and memory, to handle more demanding tasks or improve application performance.

***

### 👥 **6. Visibility & Access Control**

* **Public or Private**\
  Determine the access level of your container. Make it public for open collaboration or private for restricted access within your team.

***

### ⏳ **7. Automatic Shutdown**

* **Enable Auto-Stop**\
  Save resources by activating the auto-shutdown feature. The container will automatically stop after a period of inactivity, reducing unnecessary costs and improving efficiency.
