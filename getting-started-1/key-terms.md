# Key Terms

## **General Terminology**

### **Container**

A **Container** refers to a cloud-hosted **Virtual Machine (VM)** that serves as a development environment owned by the user. It is the primary unit where coding, testing, and debugging occur.

### **Container Stack**

The **Container Stack** refers to the pre-configured software package that is installed by default in a container. Each container has a single stack, but users can install additional software based on their project needs.

### **Template**
