### **About Credits** <a href="#about-credits_1" id="about-credits_1"></a>

Credits are the currency required for using containers. When you use containers, credits are deducted. The price per credit is $ 0.02, and you can purchase credits starting from a minimum of 50.

Credits are deducted in the following conditions, and if you don't have enough credits, the active containers may be stopped or hibernated. Deductions prioritize Free Credits.

* 45 free credits are awarded on the first day of each month, and the free credits awarded expire on the last day of the month. The time of award and expiration of free credits is based on Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
* Deducted based on the container specs while the container is running. For detailed information about container specifications, please refer to [this](https://mkdocs-mxedr.run.goorm.site/Container/Container-Specifications/#h.m6vc73hw3ms8) help documentation.
* Deducted when the total traffic from the container in your account exceeds 10GB, 10 credits will be deducted per 1GB traffic.
* Deducted when the storage usage of each container exceeds the default storage capacity, 0.018 credits will be deducted per 1GB storage per hour. Storage is the concept of providing space to store your data, which is credited regardless of whether the container is running/stopped.

You can monitor the network traffic and storage usage for each container in the _Resources Monitor_ panel at the bottom of the workspace and in the _Status bar_.
