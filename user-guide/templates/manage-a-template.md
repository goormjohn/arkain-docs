# Manage a Template

## How to Manage, Edit, and Delete Templates in the Template Community

The **Template Community** provides tools to help you manage the templates you've created. You can update your templates to reflect new changes, modify details, or delete templates you no longer need. Here's a guide to managing your templates effectively:

***

## **Managing Your Templates**

### **1. Access Your Templates**

You can access your templates through your Profile page or your **Template card in the list.**

There are three ways to go to your **Profile page**:

* Click the **\[See all]** button in the **Templates** section of your **Dashboard page**&#x20;
* Click the **\[Go to profile]** button located at the top right of your **Dashboard page**&#x20;
* Click on **your profile information** included in your **Template card**.

If there are containers that failed to create, your **Profile page** will contain the **failed templates**.

### 2. Check the comments on your template

If you click on your specific template, you can see comments left by other users.

Check out the comments and exchange opinions with various users.

***

## **Editing a Template**

Go to your specific template and click the **\[Edit]** button.

### **Steps to Edit a Template**

1. &#x20;**Check your selected Container**
   * Make sure the selected container is the one you selected when creating the template.
2. **Edit Details**
   * Update template information such as:
     * **Template name**: Ensure it accurately reflects the template's purpose.
     * **Description**: Add or revise details to clarify its features and use cases.
     * **Stack:** If there is a stack missing when creating it, add it.
     * **Recommended Spec**: If you want to change the recommended container spec, change it.
   * Update detailed description of the template
3. **Save Changes**
   * Once you've finished editing the template, click the **\[Edit]** button to save your changes.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can **only modify the information and content** of the template.&#x20;

If you want to change the container, we recommend **creating a new template.**
{% endhint %}

***

## **Deleting a Template**

### **Important Notes Before Deletion**

* Deleting a template removes it permanently from the Template Community.
* This will not affect templates already in use by other users, but new usage will no longer be available.
* Make sure to confirm before deleting to avoid accidental loss.&#x20;

### **Steps to Delete a Template**

There are two ways to delete:

1. Delete from **Template card**
   1. Click the ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/스크린샷 2025-02-24 오후 10.57.29.png>) button above your **Template card** on your **Dashboard page** or **Profile page**.
2. Go to your specific **Template page** and delete
   1. Click the **\[Delete]** button located at the top right of your specific **Template page.**
3. Confirm the deletion in the pop-up window.
