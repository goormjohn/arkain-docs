### What is Arkain's official template?

If you look through the templates, you will see templates with ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/·Ñâ·Ö≥·Ñè·Ö≥·ÑÖ·Öµ·Ü´·Ñâ·Ö£·Ü∫ 2025-02-24 ·Ñã·Ö©·Ñí·ÖÆ 11.03.46.png>) icon attached.&#x20;

These are templates that Arkain provides and produces, and as described, packages/modules for environment configuration are automatically installed and executed.

We hope that one day your templates will become official templates for Arkain.
